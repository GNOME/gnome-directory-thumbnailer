gnome-directory-thumbnailer
===========================

gnome-directory-thumbnailer is a GNOME thumbnailer utility which will generate
a thumbnail for a directory. It is intended to be called by gnome-desktop’s
thumbnailer code, but can be called manually as well.

Usage
=====

Basic usage:
 $ gnome-directory-thumbnailer path/to/directory output-thumbnail.png

Specifying the maximum thumbnail dimensions:
 $ gnome-directory-thumbnailer dir out.png -s 200
This allows the maximum height and width to be specified (in pixels).

Uninstallation
--------------

If you uninstall gnome-directory-thumbnailer, some of your directories may
retain their generated thumbnails. If this is the case, delete directories:
 ~/.cache/thumbnails
 ~/.thumbnails
to clear the generated directory thumbnails. Other thumbnails will then be
regenerated on demand.

 • gio-2.0 ≥ 2.22.0
 • gdk-pixbuf-2.0 ≥ 2.6.0
